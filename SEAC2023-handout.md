### 1. A standard case of medical surrogacy

Jane is a 21 year old woman at university.
She goes to a party one night where she drinks and takes tranquilizers.
Jane drives home but gets in a car accident.
When paramrdics arrive, she is not breathing but they resuscitate her.
However, after three weeks in a coma, the medical team determine that Jane is in a persistent vegetative state.

The medical team wants to put Jane on artificial hydration and nutrition.
However, because Jane is incapacitated, she cannot express informed consent.
How should the medical team proceed while balancing principles of respect for autonomy and beneficence?

### 2. The received view of surrogate decision making

The received view in bioethics suggests that there are three guidance principles to
follow in making medical decisions for a decisionally incapacitated patient.

2.1 Advanced directives

First, the medical team should check for advanced directives made by the patient
while previously capacitated.

This may involved instructional advanced directives, "living wills", which
stipulate the patient's desires with regards to a situation in which they can no
longer express informed consent.

Alternatively, this may involve designated proxy decision makers, "power of
attorney", which stipulate the patient's desires with regards to who they want
to make decisions for them with regards to a situation in which they can no
longer express informed consent.

3.2 Substituted judgement

Second, if no advanced directive can be found, the medical team should search
for surrogate decision makers who can act according to the substituted judgement
standard.

The surrogate is asked "to choose as the patient would if the patient were
competent and aware of both the medical options and the facts about his or her
condition." (Buchanan and Brock 1989, 94)

3.3 Best interest standard

Third, if neither of the above can be done, the medical team should act in what
they perceive to be the in the best interest of the patient.

### 3. The hypothetical case of AI surrogate decision making

Only a minority of patients have advanced directives.

Appropriate surrogates cannot always be found for all patients.

Resort to best interest standard in ignorance of the patient's preferences and, therefore, without respect to their autonomous will.

Suppose instead the medical team obtained Jane's digital footprint---all of her metadata, social media, phone records, etc. 
Whatever digital information evidences her beliefs, preferences, and decision making.
This information is fed into an AI which creates a model of the patient's medical decision making.

Suppose that this AI digital twin of the patient's decision making can reliably simulate what the patient would have chosen had they been aware of both the options and the facts.
Instead of resorting to the best interest standard for Jane, should the medical team turn to this AI digital twin to act as Jane's surrogate?

### 4. The problem for the received view

On the received view, family are preferred over non-family to act as principal
surrogate decision maker.

“The family is generally both most knowledgeable about the incompetent
individual’s good and his or her previous values and preferences, and most
concerned about the patient’s good.” (Buchanan and Brock 1989, 136) 

Preference based on epistemic criteria of reliability to reconstruct what the
patient would have consented or refused to. Thus, presumption that knowing the
patient, because it improves the chances at reconstructing the counterfactual
patient, advantages some surrogates over others.

Humans, even family, tend to not reliably perform substituted judgement.

"a right to refuse all forms of medical treatment and care, including
nutritional support by ordinary or artificial means, except when refusal imposes
significant health risks on others.” (Buchanan and Brock 1989, 93)

“I also write separately to emphasize that the Court does not today decide the
issue whether a State must also give effect to the decisions of a surrogate
decisionmaker. In my view, such a duty may well be constitutionally required to
protect the patient’s liberty interest in refusing medical treatment.” --
Justice O'Connor, *In re Cruzan*

The surrogate, ostensibly, has to get it right in order to exercise patient's
right to refuse.

In which case, we best uphold the principles of respect for patient autonomy and
beneficence by turning to the surrogate with the best epistemic reliability.

If that is the case, then it appears that we ought to prefer the AI surrogate
over family if the AI is more epistemically reliable!

### 5. The alternative rights-based approach

The received view holds that the right to refuse is both a negative right and
characterized by a performative act.

the right to refuse “is a negative right, a right not to have medical treatment
or care provided to a patient without his or her consent.” (Buchanan and Brock
1989, 92) 

> There is another way in which substituted judgement, or more precisely, its
> relationship to advanced directions, has been misunderstood. Sometimes advanced
> directives are mistakenly viewed as one especially important kind of evidence
> concerning what the individual would choose. The error here is that of failing
> to see that advanced directives are performative, not merely evidentiary. (1989,
> 116)

But, a negative right gives its holder an entitlement to noninterference
regarding the object of the right. For example, if under the law I have a right
to not be interfered in some regard like speech, then I have a negative right to
the freedom of speech. This right entails a negative obligation on the part of
others to refrain from interfering with the rights holder in the regard in
question.

As a negative right of noninterference, refusal is presumed---consent is the
performative act with special normative power.

"All rights reserved".

Any account of surrogacy has to explain how it is not a prima facie violation of
the patient's negative rights. Either:
- The patient's negative rights are waived.
- The patient's negative rights are defeased by some countervailing consideration.

It's not obvious how knowledge about the counterfactual patient either waives or
defeases the actual patient's negative rights.

One alternative account on the latter is to appeal to the patient's positive rights.

A positive right gives its holder an entitlement
to the provision of the object of the right. For example, if under the law I
have some entitlement to some good or service like education, then I have a
positive right to education. This right entails a positive obligation on the
part of others ot the rights holder to provide the good or service in question.

Abstractly, a surrogate may permissibly decide for the incapacitated patient
if they act as dutybearer to the patient's positive rights when the balance of
patient's positive and negative rights are such that the positive rights
defeases the negative rights.

### 6. An example model based on the right to be loved

The following sketches out a possible rights-based theory of medical surrogacy
based on social rights like the right to be loved.

Social rights are human rights to the relational goods necessary to a minimally
decent human life.

Matthew Liao argues that children have a right to be loved because it is a
relational good necessary to a minimally decent human life.

Liao has also argued that the elderly have a right to be loved.

Moreover, Liao argues that shared obligations to a positive right does not
entail that those who share those obligations have the same responsibilities.
There are primary dutybearers and associate dutybearers who have different
responsibilities to the rightsholder even though they are obligated by the same
right.

For example, family are the primary dutybearers to the child's right to be loved
because they are the best placed to fullfill the obligations of the child
while nonfamily are associate dutybearers.

If that is the case, then we can understand the right to be loved as persisting
over a person's life with responsibilities that wax and wane according to the
person's needs and vulnerabilities. Capacitated adults do not generate much
responsibility on the part of others in virtue of the right to be loved because
they are capable of securing those goods for themselves.

But, the decisionally incapacitated cannot fulfill their own needs because of
their vulnerability. Thus, we may have strong obligations and responsibilities
to the incapacitated patient's right to be loved.

The strength of the positive right to be loved for the incapacitated patient
defeases their negative right of noninterference.

Thus, if the surrogate acts as a dutybearer to the incapacitated patient's right
to be loved, they permissibly decide on behalf of the patient because they
defease the patient's right to noninterference.

### 7. AI medical surrogates in the rights-based approach

In order for AI to act as surrogate decision makers for an incapacitated patient
the following two conditions must be met:
1. The AI is an entity that is capable of being a dutybearer for a patient's rights.
2. The AI is an entity that is capable of fulfilling the relevant duties to
   satisfy the patient's positive rights.

Even if these conditions are met, we would then have to evaluate whether the
AI is a primary dutybearer or an associate dutybearer.

Since computer programs likely do not meet these conditions, the burden of proof
rests on demonstrating the AI digital twin has the special capabilities to meet
these conditions and to serve as either primary or associate dutybearer.
