### 1. The standard case of medical surrogacy



### 2. The received view of surrogate decision making

The received view in bioethics suggests that there are three guidance principles to
follow in making medical decisions for an incapacitated patient.

2.1 Advanced directives

First, the medical team should check for advanced directives made by the patient
while previously capacitated.

This may involved instructional advanced directives, "living wills", which
stipulate the patient's desires with regards to a situation in which they can no
longer express informed consent.

Alternatively, this may involve designated proxy decision makers, "power of
attorney", which stipulate the patient's desires with regards to who they want
to make decisions for them with regards to a situation in which they can no
longer express informed consent.

3.2 Substituted judgement

Second, if no advanced directive can be found, the medical team should search
for surrogate decision makers who can act according to the substituted judgement
standard.

The surrogate is asked "to choose as the patient would if the patient were
competent and aware of both the medical options and the facts about his or her
condition." (Buchanan and Brock 1989, 94)

3.3 Best interest standard

Third, if neither of the above can be done, the medical team should act in what
they perceive to be the in the best interest of the patient.

### 3. The hypothetical case of AI surrogate decision making

### 4. The problem for the received view

### 5. The alternative rights-based approach

### 6. An example model based on the right to be loved

### 7. AI medical surrogates in the rights-based approach

In order for AI to act as surrogate decision makers for an incapacitated patient
the following two conditions must be met:
1. The AI is an entity that is capable of being a dutybearer for a patient's rights.
2. The AI is an entity that is capable of fulfilling the relevant duties to
   satisfy the patient's positive rights.

Even if these conditions are met, we would then have to evaluate whether the
AI is a primary dutybearer or an associate dutybearer.

Since computer programs likely do not meet these conditions, the burden of proof
rests on demonstrating the AI digital twin has the special capabilities to meet
these conditions and to serve as either primary or associate dutybearer.
